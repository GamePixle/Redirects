This is not really a project and more of just some redirects I've meda to better customize my PC.

I have one with a redirect to Codeacademy with a custom favicon.

The other is a set of pages that I commonly use when on the Tastycat community in Plug.Dj shortened down to one page that opens a bunch of others.

If something isn't working properly, make sure you put the html file and the favicon.ico file in the same folder/directory.

If the Tastycat one isn't working, then disable popup blocking on that page.
